                I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned
                were current,if not more so in the company I joined.I honestly
                feel I got every penny's worth

                " I was an EMT for many years before i joined the bootcamp. I've
                been looking to make a transition and have heard some people who
                had an amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro
                course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
                thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most
                grueling-time of my life. Since completing the, I've
                successfully switched careers,working as Software Engineer at a
                VR StartUp"

                "Before I joined I've never written a single line of code. I
                needed some structions from proffessional who can help learn
                programming step by step.I was encouraged to enroll by a former
                students of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the
                program. The entire curruculum and staff did not disappoint.They
                were very hands-on and I never had to wait long for
                assistance.The agile team project, in particular , was
                outstanding, it took my learning to the next level in a way that
                no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I've often referred to it
                during interviews as an example of my development experience. It
                certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack developer after
                receciving multiple offers. 100% recommend! "
